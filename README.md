# Banngla_ASR
Bangla automatic speech recognition with transformer and language model

To run inference:

1. download and extract model checkpoint files to bn_asr directory

2. download and extract language model file to language_model_directory

3. run main.py for audio recording (recording would be less than 2 seconds)

4. run inference.py for inference 

TODO:

Use language model file for better prediction\n
GUI for speech recognition\n
implement Beam search for decoding
